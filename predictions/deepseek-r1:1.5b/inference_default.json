    "8": "To solve this problem, we need to retrieve the district names for schools that have students in grades 7 or 8 (i.e., districts with K-12 schools) along with their SAT1 and SAT2 scores. The goal is to identify these districts based on the maximum number of students per school.### ApproachThe approach involves the following steps:1. **Identify Maximum Students per District**: First, we need to determine the district(s) that have the maximum number of students (students per school). This will help us narrow down the districts we are interested in.2. **Select Districts with K-12 Students**: From the identified districts with the maximum student count, we further filter out those districts where the student body is exactly 7 or 8 years old (K-12).3. **Retrieve SAT Scores for Identified Districts**: Finally, we retrieve the SAT1 and SAT2 scores for each of these filtered districts.### Solution CodeSELECT s.nameFROM schools sWHERE s.cdsCode IN (    SELECT cd FROM frpm c WHERE c.district = 'K-12' AND c.frp = (        SELECT MAX(frp.count) FROM frpm c WHERE c.district = 'K-12'    )) AND s.district = 'K-12';### Explanation- **Identify Maximum Students per District**: The inner query `SELECT MAX(frp.count) FROM frpm c WHERE c.district = 'K-12'` retrieves the maximum number of students (students per school) in districts with K-12 students.- **Filter Distances with K-12 Students**: The outer query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to select all CDs that have this maximum student count. This ensures we only consider districts where the maximum student count is achieved and the district is K-12.- **Retrieve SAT Scores**: Finally, the outermost query selects the district names from the schools table where their CD code matches the ones identified in the previous step. This gives us all the districts with K-12 students along with their SAT scores.This approach efficiently narrows down the districts of interest and retrieves the necessary information using a combination of subqueries and common table expressions for clarity and readability.\n\t----- bird -----\tcalifornia_schools",

From these, we can determine which molecules contain iodine by matching them to their respective molecule IDs.- **Count Bond IDs for Each Molecule**: For each molecule ID that contains iodine, we count how many times it appears as a bond ID in the `connected` table. This is done using `COALESCE(COUNT(DISTINCT bond_id))`, which ensures that if a molecule ID appears multiple times (e.g., due to multiple bonds), it only counts once per unique molecule.This approach efficiently counts each bond ID associated with iodine, ensuring accurate results while avoiding duplication issues.\n\t----- bird -----\ttoxicology",

This ensures we only work with legally valid sets.2. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: A CTE is used to select these legalities, allowing us to perform additional joins without repeating the table structure.3. **Join with Cards**: Each legality is joined with the cards table using their UUIDs. This helps in identifying which card it belongs to.4. **Extract Translation Information**: From the card's id obtained from the CTE, we join with the set_translations table to get the translation information for each set.This approach efficiently retrieves all necessary information about legal sets that include at least one card from Italy, ensuring accuracy and completeness in the results.\n\t----- bird -----\tcard_games",

The card belongs to a set that includes a paper-only version (i.e., it can be printed only on paper).3. The card has a sensitive content status.### Step-by-Step Explanation:1. **Filter by Frame Version**: We start by selecting cards where `frameVersion` is '1993'.2. **Check for Paper Availability**: We need to determine if the card belongs to a set that includes paper-only versions. This can be done using a common foreign key or an explicit condition in the `sets` table.3. **Check Sensitive Content Status**: Using the `legalities` table, we check if the status is 'sensitive'.### SQL Query:SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards c  WHERE frameVersion = '1993'  AND (exists (    SELECT s.id      FROM sets s      WHERE s.uuid = c.uuid      AND s.isPaperOnly = 1 /* Assuming this is the condition for paper availability */  ) OR exists (    SELECT s.id      FROM sets s      WHERE s.uuid = c.uuid      AND s.isPaperOnly = 0  ))  AND status IN ('sensitive', 'sensitive')### Explanation:- **SELECT COUNT(*)**: We count the number of cards that meet all conditions.  - **WHERE frameVersion = '1993'**: This filters the cards to only those with the specified version.- **(exists (...) OR exists (...))**: This checks if the card belongs to a set that includes paper-only versions. The `exists` subquery retrieves the IDs of sets where the card's UUID matches and the set is either paper-only or digital-only.- **status IN ('sensitive', 'sensitive')**: Using the `legalities` table, we check if the status is 'sensitive'.This query efficiently combines multiple conditions to retrieve the desired cards while considering both physical availability (paper) and sensitive content.\n\t----- bird -----\tcard_games",

    "479": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of cards in set Coldsnap where the \"power\" is considered unknown (represented as NULL) and the \"convertedManaCost\" is greater than 5. ### Approach1. **Identify the Set ID**: First, we identify the ID of set Coldsnap from the `sets` table.2. **Retrieve Cards in the Set**: Using the identified set ID, we retrieve all cards that belong to this set.3. **Filter by ConvertedManaCost and Power**: From the retrieved cards, we filter those where \"convertedManaCost\" is greater than 5 and \"power\" is NULL.4. **Count the Filtered Cards**: Finally, we count how many such filtered cards exist.### Solution CodeSELECT COUNT(*) FROM (    SELECT id AS setId     FROM sets     WHERE id = 'Coldsnap') AS s  IN (    SELECT id, id     FROM cards     WHERE id = s.id AND convertedManaCost >5  )WHERE power = NULL;### Explanation- **Identify the Set ID**: The `sets` table has a foreign key `id`, which uniquely identifies each set. We fetch this ID for 'Coldsnap' using a common table expression (CTE).- **Retrieve Cards in the Set**: Using the identified set ID, we perform an inner join with the `cards` table to get all cards belonging to this set.- **Filter by ConvertedManaCost and Power**: From the retrieved cards, we apply two conditions: converted mana cost > 5 and power is NULL. This ensures we only consider cards that meet both criteria.- **Count the Filtered Cards**: The COUNT function is used to count how many cards satisfy all the above conditions.This approach efficiently narrows down the relevant cards and applies the necessary filters, providing an accurate count of unknown power cards in set Coldsnap with a mana cost greater than 5.\n\t----- bird -----\tcard_games",

    "484": "To solve the problem, we need to retrieve the ASCII names of cards in the \"Coldsnap\" set along with their converted mana cost. The solution involves joining the necessary tables and using a subquery to ensure all relevant legalities are included.### Approach1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: We have three main tables: `cards`, `legalities`, and `sets`.2. **Join Cards with Legalities**: Use a subquery to join the cards table with the legalities table on the card's identifier (`id`). This ensures we include all legalities that are linked to any card.3. **Filter by Set ID**: From the joined result, filter out the rows where the set ID matches \"Coldsnap\".4. **Order by Converted Mana Cost**: Order the resulting rows by converted mana cost in descending order to get the highest values first.### Solution CodeSELECT c.asciiName FROM cards c WHERE c.set_id IN (SELECT uuid AS card_uuid FROM legalities l WHERE l.uuid = c.id) AND c.set_id = 'Coldsnap'ORDER BY c.converted_mana_cost DESC;### Explanation- **Subquery for Legalities**: The inner subquery `SELECT uuid AS card_uuid FROM legalities l WHERE l.uuid = c.id` retrieves the UUID (which is the same as the identifier) from the legalities table where the set ID matches the card's ID. This ensures we include all legalities that are associated with any card.- **Filter by Set ID**: The outer query filters rows where the set ID (`c.set_id`) equals \"Coldsnap\". This restricts our results to only those cards belonging to the \"Coldsnap\" set.- **Ordering**: The result is ordered by `converted_mana_cost` in descending order, so we get the highest converted mana cost first.This approach efficiently combines multiple tables and uses a subquery to ensure all necessary legalities are included, providing an accurate and ordered list of cards.\n\t----- bird -----\tcard_games",

The solution involves selecting relevant data from two tables and performing calculations based on these selections.### Approach1. **Identify Female Patients**: We start by identifying all female patients using a foreign key reference from the `Patient` table.2. **Check UAC Against Normal Value**: For each identified female patient, we check if their UAC exceeds the specified normal value.3. **Calculate Percentage**: We calculate the percentage of female patients whose UAC is above the normal value by dividing the count of such patients by the total number of female patients and then multiplying by 100.### Solution CodeSELECT     (COUNT(*)      FROM      (        SELECT EXAMINATION.ID, EXAMINATION.aCL IgM real as UAC         FROM Examination         WHERE ID IN          (             SELECT Patient.ID             FROM Patient             WHERE SEX = 'female'         )      )     WHERE UAC > normal) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (         SELECT EXAMINATION.ID, EXAMINATION.aCL IgM real as UAC          FROM Examination          WHERE ID IN           (              SELECT Patient.ID              FROM Patient              WHERE SEX = 'female'          )        ) * 100) AS percentage;### Explanation- **SELECTing Female Patients**: The inner query selects all patients where the gender is 'female' using a `FROM` clause with a `WHERE` clause based on the `SEX` column.- **Checking UAC Against Normal**: The outer query counts how many of these female patients have a UAC greater than the specified normal value. This count is then divided by the total number of female patients to find the percentage.- **Calculating Percentage**: The result is formatted as a percentage, providing the proportion of female patients with UAC above the normal value.This approach efficiently combines data selection and calculation using SQL, ensuring clarity and correctness in determining the required percentage.\n\t----- bird -----\tthrombosis_prediction",
