This involves analyzing superhero attributes, superpowers, and hero power data.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationships**: \n   - `superhero_attribute` links superheroes to their attributes.\n   - `superpower` links superheroes to their powers.\n   - `hero_power` links superheroes to their values.\n\n3. **Formulate the SQL Query**:\n   - **Join Tables**: We need to join the `superhero_attribute`, `superpower`, and `hero_power` tables based on the superhero IDs.\n   - **Filter by Self-Interest**: Use a subquery to filter superheroes who have at least one attribute or power that is themselves.\n   - **Calculate Percentage**: Calculate the percentage of superheroes who meet the criteria.\n\n4. **Construct the SQL Query**:\n   - Start with the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns we want to retrieve: `COUNT(*)` for the number of superheroes who meet the criteria and `SUM(CASE WHEN T2.all_ones_1 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(T1.numbers_0)` for the percentage.\n\n5. **Finalize the Query**:\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter superheroes who have at least one attribute or power that is themselves.\n   - Use `GROUP BY T1.numbers_0` to group the results by superhero ID.\n\nAccordingly, the final SQL query is:\n\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) ,  SUM(CASE WHEN T2.all_ones_1 = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(T1.numbers_0) FROM superhero_attribute AS T1 JOIN superpower AS T2 ON T1.numbers_0 = T2.numbers_0 JOIN hero_power AS T3 ON T1.numbers_0 = T3.numbers_0 WHERE T2.all_ones_1 = 1\n\n\n\t----- bird -----\tsuperhero",

    "1486": "Let's walk through the question and the database.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to find out if more SMEs pay in Czech koruna than in euros. This requires us to compare the average scores of SMEs in both currencies.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to derive the SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**: We need to access data from the `customers`, `gasstations`, and `products` tables. The `customers` table contains information about customers, including their average scores, while the `gasstations` table contains information about gas stations, including their average scores.\n\n2. **Join the tables**: Since we need to compare the average scores of SMEs in both currencies, we need to join these two tables on the `numbers_0` column, which is common to both tables.\n\n3. **Filter SMEs by country**: We are only interested in SMEs from Czech Republic, so we need to filter the results based on the `CzechRepublicCodes_2` column in the `customers` table.\n\n4. **Calculate the average scores**: For each SME, we calculate their average score in both currencies using the `average_scores_7` column in the `transactions_1k` table.\n\n5. **Compare the average scores**: We compare the average scores of SMEs in Czech and euros and count how many more they pay in Czech than in euros.\n\n6. **Write the SQL query**: Based on the above steps, we can write the SQL query as follows\n\nAccordingly, the final SQL query is:\n\n\nSELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.CzechRepublicCodes_2 = 'Czech Republic' THEN T3.average_scores_7 ELSE NULL END) AS more_sme_czech_euros\nFROM customers AS T1\nJOIN gasstations AS T2 ON T1.numbers_0 = T2.numeric_values_0\nJOIN products AS T3 ON T2.values_1 = T3.fuel_types_1;\n\n\t----- bird -----\tdebit_card_specializing",
