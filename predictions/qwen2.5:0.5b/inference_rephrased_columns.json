It then orders the results by the `id` in descending order and limits the result to 1. The `ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1` clause ensures that the first row returned is the completed order with the lowest `id`. If there are no such rows, it returns an empty result set. \n\t----- bird -----\tcard_games",
